# VIP-3: Fund Gauntlet for on-chain risk management

Status: Draft 

## Summary

Request to partner with Gauntlet for continuous on-chain risk management 

## Background

Gauntlet is a simulation platform for market risk management and parameter optimization. Gauntlet uses battle-tested techniques from the algorithmic trading industry to inform on-chain protocol management. We use agent-based simulation to help protocols manage risk, capital efficiency, fees, and rewards. Recent work, relevant to Vesper Grow Pools, includes assessments for [Compound](https://gauntlet.network/reports/compound), [Aave](https://gauntlet.network/reports/aave), and [MakerDAO](https://maker-report.gauntlet.network/). Our continuous optimization work, similar to what we would like to do for Vesper, includes [Balancer](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/balancer-partners-with-gauntlet-to-make-dynamic-fee-pools-a-reality-97b3fb1760df), [SushiSwap](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/optimizing-token-emissions-for-sushiswap-23dfe5bf9962), and [Acala](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlet-to-provide-automated-financial-risk-management-for-acala-and-karura-3f912adfe3a7). 

## Proposal 

Following Gauntlet's initial due diligence on the Vesper protocol and Grow Pools, our two main concerns were static risk management and arbitrary collateralization benchmarks. Static risk management has no place in DeFi. Volatility, liquidity, and other variables like network congestion make continuous risk management necessary to improve capital efficiency and maximize yields. The second issue is the low-water and high-water collateralization benchmarks. The initial benchmarks are understandably meant to be conservative, but how is that measured? Can they be more aggressive, improve yield, and still be considered conservative? Gauntlet's quantitative analysis can set risk levels to help users construct a portfolio suited to their risk tolerance. 

Gauntletâ€™s top-line goal is to increase Vesper TVL, which will drive value to the protocol and token long-term. How will Gauntlet execute this? 

Gauntlet will ingest numerous live data feeds from Ethereum, centralized and decentralized exchanges, and the Vesper contracts to ensure our models can remain in lockstep with changing market conditions. The data is then ingested into numerous specialized models. For Vesper, Gauntlet will deploy the following models: 

- Market Liquidity Model: Slippage and price impact
- Agent Models: Borrower and liquidator behavior
- [MultiGBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion) model: Covariance matrix and price trajectories
- Transaction Delay Model: Gas prices and confirmation delay

The above models coalesce into the Lending Risk Model, which will have the primary function of outputting collateralization benchmarks. Gauntlet's models may identify other risks and optimization opportunities. For example, Vesper's rebalancing mechanism may require upgrades as more strategies and assets enter the Grow Pools. When identified, Gauntlet will proactively make governance proposals, similar to how we do for [Compound Governance](https://compound.finance/governance/address/0x6626593c237f530d15ae9980a95ef938ac15c35c), to ensure the protocol is functioning optimally.

Gauntlet will develop a Vesper Risk Management Dashboard to provide easy-to-digest metrics across assets, strategies, and risk levels. For any simulation output or suggested protocol upgrade, Vespernauts can expect to find Gauntlet active in the community (e.g., Discord) to provide clarifications and follow-ups from our analysis. 

Gauntlet is confident our platform can provide value to all stakeholders in the Vesper community as it continues to grow.
